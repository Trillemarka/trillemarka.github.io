This is just a test.

First english blog post!

Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

Then we'll go with that data file! It's toe-tappingly tragic! Negative, bossy meat creature! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.

Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

Why would I want to know that? No, just a regular mistake. And then the battle's not so bad? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

Meh.
You wouldn't. Ask anyway!
Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!
